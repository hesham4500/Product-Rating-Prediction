### **Problem Statement:**
The rise in e-commerce has brought a significant increase in the importance of customer reviews. There are hundreds of online review sites and massive reviews for every product. 

When you have a new product to be put on wish.com, you can estimate how likely people will like your product, without actually listing out there. It also allows us to understand what conditions will make a product highly rated on wish.com, as a way of understanding their customer base.

### **Notebook Description**:  
This notebook is intended to predict the product ratings given the other features known for a product on `Wish.com`. Ratings are in categories from 1 to 5. For one product, the higher the rating is, the more the customers like the product. It used 4 diffrent algorithms with 3 diffrent data cpmbinations.
 
### **Deliverable:**
 A python notebook containing the documentation of the final design as well as the answers to the questions.
